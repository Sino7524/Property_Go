# Property_Go
Property Go is a prototype application which allows the creation of appointments and the purchase of properties. It has a friendly user interface with a whole lot of features to accomodate for every single user such as the Text-To-Speech Feature.

Scope: The program was be developed using the Delphi 2010 IDE (Integrated Development Environment). The program allows the user to create a realtor or client account, the first time it is run. Both realtors and clients are able to view property listings. Clients are able to create appointments, which are stored in a database, in a table contains a field called “Approved”. This field (of type Boolean) is checked only if the specified realtor approves of the appointment. The program also allows clients to report realtors, (This increases the number of reports stored in a database) and when a realtor reaches 3 reports, the data analyst is notified to allow them to “delete” the realtor. The program also allows the data analyst to view analytics of the data (which include percentages of fired realtors etc.)

The application utilizes (but is not limited to) the following data structures and programming constructs: 

1.	A normalized database (with 5 related tables) to store and organize the data input from the user and to allow for the use of different manipulation operations to the data.
2.	The use of text files for storing user preferences in the form of cookies.
3.	A minimum of 3 forms with navigation techniques. UX (User experience) principles are also used to ensure a smooth transition between different components on the form and the forms themselves.
4.	Other data structures (such as arrays, classes and objects, etc.)
