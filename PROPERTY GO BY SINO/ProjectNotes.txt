==========================================================================

*1. How To Create A Client Account 

When you open the application, the first screen you will see is the Sign In screen. Regardless of whether you are an existing user or not, you will notice the text: "Not a User? Sign Up." If you do not have an account, you can click on the "Sign Up" link, highlighted in purple. This will direct you to the Sign Up screen, where you can enter the required information to create your account. Select the "Client" option on the User Type combo box to create a Client account.  

*2 "The username box isn't accessible, how can I fix this?"
The username field is not accessible during account creation, as the application will automatically generate a unique username for you. Once your account is created, you will be directed to the Sign In screen, where your username will be automatically populated in the "Username" field. You will then be prompted to enter the password you created in order to sign in.   

*3 "I forgot my password. What should I do?"
If you have forgotten your password, you will need to contact the administrators for assistance in creating a new one.

*4 How To Create An Appointment
To create an appointment, click on the calendar icon (featuring a plus sign) located next to the property image on the left side of the property view screen. This action will take you to the appointment scheduler screen, where a unique appointment ID will be automatically generated for your future appointment, and the property ID will be displayed in the "Property ID" field. You will then need to select a realtor to manage the appointment and choose a suitable appointment date. Once all required fields are completed, an email containing the appointment details will be sent to you.

*5 Meaning of "Realtor does not exist error"
The "Realtor Does Not Exist" error indicates that the realtor you have selected is either no longer employed with the company or has retired.

*6. What is property data and how to purchase it?
Property data refers to information that describes and defines real estate properties, encompassing a range of attributes that provide details about the property in question. This data typically includes the following key elements:

This data typically includes:

Current Market Price: The price at which the property is currently listed for sale or rent. This figure is usually determined by factors such as location, property type, and market conditions.

Price History: A record of past prices at which the property has been sold or rented. This history can help users understand how the property's value has changed over time, reflecting trends in the local real estate market.

Comparative Market Analysis (CMA): A detailed comparison of the propertyâ€™s price with similar properties in the area. This analysis helps in assessing whether the property is priced competitively and gives insights into market trends.

Valuation Estimates: An estimated market value of the property based on various data points such as recent sales of similar properties, current market conditions, and the property's specific features. These estimates can help buyers and investors gauge whether a property is priced appropriately.

Pricing Trends: Information about broader market trends that affect property prices, such as economic indicators, interest rates, and local developments. This might include price increases or decreases over a certain period, indicating the health of the real estate market.

Rental Yields: For investment properties, this data includes the potential or actual rental income relative to the property's purchase price, expressed as a percentage. This is crucial for investors looking to assess the profitability of a property.

Cost of Ownership: Beyond the purchase price, this includes ongoing costs such as property taxes, maintenance fees, and insurance. These costs are important for buyers to understand the total financial commitment required.

Discounts and Negotiations: Information on any price reductions, discounts, or ongoing negotiations can also be part of the property data, helping potential buyers understand how flexible the pricing might be.

Loan and Financing Data: Details on available mortgage options, interest rates, and other financing terms that can affect the overall cost of purchasing the property. This also includes data on how financing might influence the final price paid by the buyer.

When you click the green button labelled "Purchase," you will be directed to a secure payment screen where you will be required to enter your card information exactly as it appears on your card. Please ensure all details are accurate to avoid any issues with the transaction. Upon successful payment, you will immediately gain access to the comprehensive data for the selected property. For your security, all payment information is encrypted and processed in accordance with industry standards.
